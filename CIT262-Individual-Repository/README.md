About Me
=======

I'm Corban Evans, I am a CIT major with a minor in Psych.

I enjoy playing D&D, board games, and watching practically movie that has ever been made with my lovely wife.

I really don't like doing "About Me" sections so that is going to be the end of me talking about myself. Thank you. Bye.
